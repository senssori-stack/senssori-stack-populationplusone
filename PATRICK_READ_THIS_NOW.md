### **PATENT DESCRIPTION TEMPLATE:**
```
FIELD OF INVENTION:
A mobile application system that creates personalized time capsule gifts by combining current event announcements (birth/birthday) with historically accurate data from the specific date, enabling users to generate both baby announcements and milestone birthday gifts with contextual historical information.

BACKGROUND:
Traditional birth announcement and gift-giving applications fail to provide historical context or serve dual purposes. Users seeking meaningful, personalized gifts lack access to verified historical data from specific dates, particularly for milestone birthdays.

SUMMARY OF INVENTION:
The present invention provides a revolutionary dual-mode system that:
1. Generates professional birth announcements with historical data from birth date
2. Creates birthday "time capsule" gifts showing historical context from any past date
3. Integrates 110+ years of verified government data (gas prices, population, presidents, etc.)
4. Enables seamless printing and sharing of physical keepsakes
5. Targets both new parent market (3.6M annually) and birthday gift market (330M Americans)

KEY INNOVATIONS:
- Dual-mode interface switching between baby/birthday contexts
- Historical data integration from government sources (BLS, EIA, Census, FRED)
- Automated layout generation for portrait/landscape orientations
- Print-ready export with professional typography
- Watermark system for viral marketing
