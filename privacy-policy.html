        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Population +1™ — Last Updated: February 15, 2026</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Summary:</strong> Population +1 stores your data locally on your device. We do not collect,
            transmit, or sell your personal information. Your baby's data stays on your phone.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Population +1 ("the App") may collect and store the following information <strong>locally on your device
                only</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Baby Information:</strong> Name and date of birth entered by you to personalize announcements,
                milestone tracking, and growth charts.</li>
            <li><strong>Milestone &amp; Growth Data:</strong> Developmental milestones you mark as completed, notes you
                add, and growth measurements (weight, height, head circumference).</li>
            <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Images you select from your device's photo library for use in birth
                announcements, keepsakes, and milestone records. Photos are processed locally and are not uploaded to
                our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Form Data:</strong> Birth details (date, time, weight, length, hospital, city, state) you enter
                to generate personalized announcements and keepsakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Preferences:</strong> App settings, streak data, learning progress, and cart contents
                stored locally.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>All data you enter is used solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generate personalized birth announcements, natal charts, time capsules, yard signs, postcards, baseball
                cards, and memorial keepsakes.</li>
            <li>Track your baby's developmental milestones and growth.</li>
            <li>Provide educational content through the learning center.</li>
            <li>Save your progress and preferences between sessions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
        <p>All personal data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using AsyncStorage. We do not operate
            user accounts, and your data is not synced to any cloud server or database controlled by us.</p>
        <p>If you uninstall the App or clear its data, all locally stored information will be permanently deleted.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App may interact with the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Printful (Print &amp; Ship):</strong> If you choose to order a printed product, your order
                details (product type, shipping address you provide at checkout) are sent to Printful, Inc. to fulfill
                your order. Printful's privacy policy applies to that data. No data is sent to Printful unless you
                explicitly initiate a print order.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Used for serverless functions that support the printing service. No
                personal user data is stored in Firebase.</li>
            <li><strong>Population Data APIs:</strong> The App fetches publicly available population statistics. No
                personal data is sent in these requests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use any analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs. We do not use Google Analytics,
            Facebook SDK, or any similar services.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Population +1 is designed for <strong>parents and guardians</strong> to create keepsakes and track milestones
            for their children. The App does not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect data directly from children.</li>
            <li>Require children to interact with the App.</li>
            <li>Share any child's information with third parties.</li>
            <li>Display advertisements of any kind.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All information about a child (name, date of birth, photos, milestones) is entered by a parent or guardian
            and stored only on that parent's device. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
            and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, trade, rent, or share your personal data with any third party for marketing
            or advertising purposes. Period.</p>
        <p>Data leaves your device only when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You explicitly choose to share a generated image (via your device's share sheet).</li>
            <li>You explicitly place a print order (data sent to Printful for fulfillment only).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Because all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your data is visible within the App at all times.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete your data by clearing the App's data in your device settings
                or by uninstalling the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Generated images can be saved to your device's photo library and shared as
                you choose.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App may request the following device permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> To select photos for announcements and to save generated keepsake
                images.</li>
            <li><strong>Camera (if applicable):</strong> To take photos for use in announcements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These permissions are optional. The App functions without them, though some features (photo-based
            announcements, saving images) will be limited.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an
            updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised
            policy.</p>
