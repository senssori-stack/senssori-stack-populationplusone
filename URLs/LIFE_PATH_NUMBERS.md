## Life Path Number Calculation
To find your Life Path Number, add up the individual digits of your full birth date (Month + Day + Year) and keep reducing the sum by adding its digits until you reach a single digit (1-9) or a Master Number (11, 22, 33).

### Step-by-step calculation:
1. Write out your full birth date (e.g., March 29, 1969)
2. Reduce the Month, Day, and Year separately to single digits or Master Numbers
3. Add the reduced numbers together
4. Reduce the final sum to a single digit (or Master Number)

### Example:
May 5, 1992 (5/5/1992)
- Month: 5
- Day: 5
- Year: 1 + 9 + 9 + 2 = 21, then 2 + 1 = 3
- Total: 5 + 5 + 3 = 13, then 1 + 3 = 4
- **Life Path Number: 4**

### Key Points:
- Master Numbers: 11, 22, 33 are not reduced further
