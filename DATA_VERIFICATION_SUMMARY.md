## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Going Forward (2025+)
**You'll need to manually update Google Sheets** with:
- Monthly commodity prices (gas, milk, etc.)
- Annual population figures
- New sports winners, chart leaders, etc.

But this is NORMAL - it's how any time capsule system works. You can't have accurate future data until the future arrives!

### Pre-1971 Electricity
**Electricity data starts at 1971**
- Pre-1971 accurate data unavailable
- System handles gracefully
- Not an issue (99% of users born after 1971)

### Pre-1968 Precious Metals
**Gold/Silver prices start at 1968**
- Fixed government prices pre-1968 (not useful)
- System handles gracefully
- Minimal impact
