        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="date">Last updated: December 25, 2025</p>

        <p><strong>Population +1</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Information You Provide:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Baby/person name (for announcement creation)</li>
            <li>Birth date (to retrieve historical data)</li>
            <li>Hometown/city name (for population lookup)</li>
            <li>Photos you upload (stored locally on your device only)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Information We Do NOT Collect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect personal contact information</li>
            <li>We do not track your location</li>
            <li>We do not create user accounts</li>
            <li>We do not store your data on external servers</li>
            <li>We do not sell any user data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Your Information Is Used</h2>
        <p>All information you enter is used solely to generate your personalized birth announcement or birthday time capsule. Your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stays on your device</li>
            <li>Is not transmitted to our servers</li>
            <li>Is not shared with third parties</li>
            <li>Is not used for advertising or marketing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Photo Access</h2>
        <p>Our app requests access to your photo library to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow you to select photos for your announcement</li>
            <li>Save your completed announcement to your photo library</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Photos are processed locally on your device and are never uploaded to external servers.</p>

        <h2>Historical Data</h2>
        <p>The historical data displayed in your announcements (gas prices, population statistics, presidential information, etc.) is sourced from publicly available government records and is included within the app itself. No external data requests are made based on your personal information.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>If you choose to print your announcement through third-party printing services (such as FedEx Office, Shutterfly, etc.), those services have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review their policies before using their services.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app is designed for use by parents, grandparents, and family members to create announcements. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since all data remains on your device and is not transmitted to external servers, your information is protected by your device's built-in security features.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
        <p><strong>Email:</strong> support@populationplusone.com</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we don't collect or store your personal data on our servers, there is no data to request, modify, or delete. All your announcement data exists solely on your device and can be deleted by uninstalling the app or clearing app data.</p>
